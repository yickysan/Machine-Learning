# Predicting Car Prices Using K Nearest Neighbours

* K Nearest Neighbours is a  machine learning algorithm that works by calculating the distance between the train and test samples ad returning the value whih is the closest distance between the two samples.

* In this project, I worked with data from the <a href = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a> to make predictions on car prices using K Nearest Neighbours.
